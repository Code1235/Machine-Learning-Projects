<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Loan Classification Model</h1>
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting loan approval based on various applicant features. The goal is to classify whether a loan application will be approved or not, using historical data about loan applicants.

---

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Project Overview</h1>
The Loan Classification Model uses a dataset containing features like applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant information to predict whether a loan will be approved. The model is built using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with an emphasis on feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Features</h1>
The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned, including the following key steps:

Handling missing values
Feature scaling (normalization/standardization)
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Model<h1>
The model uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the loan approval status:

- Logistic Regression: A basic linear model to predict binary outcomes.
- Decision Trees: A non-linear model to capture complex patterns in the data.
- AdaBoostClassifier: An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to improve accuracy.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, non-parametric classifier that classifies new data points based on the majority label of its neighbors.
- XGBoost: A powerful boosting algorithm that works well with structured/tabular data.
